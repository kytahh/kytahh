Sure! To convert your code to use JSON instead of plain text, you will need to import the `json` module and make use of the `json.dump()` and `json.load()` functions.

Here's an example of how you can convert a simple code snippet to use JSON:

```python
import json

# Example code with plain text
data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Convert data to JSON and save to a file
with open('data.json', 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump(data, outfile)

# Load JSON data from file and convert it to Python object
with open('data.json', 'r') as infile:
    loaded_data = json.load(infile)

# Access the loaded data
print(loaded_data["name"])
print(loaded_data["age"])
print(loaded_data["city"])
```

In this example, the `json.dump(data, outfile)` function is used to convert the Python dictionary `data` to JSON format and save it to a file called `data.json`. 

The `json.load(infile)` function is used to load the JSON data from the file `data.json` and convert it back to a Python object, which can be accessed like any other dictionary.

Remember to replace the usage of plain text with the JSON conversion functions wherever necessary in your code.
